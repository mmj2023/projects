# Ignore Windows executables
*.exe

# Ignore Linux/macOS executables (no extension, marked as executable)
# This ignores any file with the executable bit set
# but since Git can't filter by permissions in .gitignore,
# you usually ignore by directory or pattern, e.g.:
# bin/
build/
# dist/
*.out
*.o
*.so
*.a
*.bin

# Ignore Node.js dependencies
node_modules/
